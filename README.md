## üîç Project Overview

This project automates every stage of the DevOps lifecycle for a Java-based command-line application using a modern toolchain. It starts from setting up a Maven project and Git repository and progresses through testing with JUnit, containerization using Docker, deployment via Minikube, monitoring with Grafana + Graphite + Collectd, and complete orchestration using Ansible. Jenkins integrates these components in a robust CI/CD pipeline using both freestyle and scripted (pipeline) methods.

With source code changes automatically triggering builds through Git polling, the pipeline ensures every update is tested, deployed, and monitored in real-time. If errors are encountered, automated rollback mechanisms kick in using Jenkins and Ansible to maintain application stability.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project presents a complete end-to-end DevOps implementation by combining a wide array of technologies into a single CI/CD pipeline. It simplifies the software development and deployment process by making it fully automated, traceable, reliable, and testable at each stage. With Jenkins handling SCM triggers, Maven builds, and role-based Ansible playbooks, the pipeline ensures that every update is automatically tested, deployed, monitored, and recoverable in case of failure.

DevOps not only accelerates development workflows but also enhances team collaboration, monitoring, and operational stability in real-world projects. This hands-on implementation provides a foundational blueprint for organizations seeking to adopt modern DevOps methodologies.
